    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>

    <p>
      EZDownloads (“we”, “us”, or “our”) operates <a href="/">https://ezdownload.xyz</a> (the “Site”).  
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal data when you visit our Site or use our download services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Browser Fingerprinting</h3>
    <p>
      We may use a minimal browser-fingerprinting script to improve security, prevent abuse, and gather aggregate statistics.  
      This script collects non-personally-identifiable technical details such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system and device type</li>
        <li>Screen resolution and language settings</li>
        <li>Installed fonts and plugins (limited subset)</li>
      </ul>
      None of this data is used to identify you personally or shared with third parties beyond our security services.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Server Logs & IP Addresses</h3>
    <p>
      Our hosting provider automatically logs your IP address, user agent, and the pages you request.  
      We use this information solely for security (e.g., blocking abusive requests) and performance monitoring.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Cookies & Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      We use strictly <strong>essential cookies</strong> (e.g., session cookies for site functionality). If you enable optional features such as analytics or tracking, we will ask for your consent separately.  
      You can find details in our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security & Fraud Prevention:</strong> To block bots, prevent download abuse, and maintain site integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & Improvement:</strong> To collect aggregate, anonymous statistics about site usage (e.g., page views, most-downloaded files). We do <em>not</em> track or store personal data beyond what is strictly needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Support & Contact:</strong> If you email us, we may store your email address and message content to respond to inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>
      If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using your data is:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Ensuring the security and availability of our Site and preventing abuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For any optional analytics or tracking scripts (e.g., third-party analytics) when such features are enabled by you.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain server logs and fingerprinting data for up to 30 days for security and troubleshooting.  
      Any data you send via email (e.g., support requests) is retained only as long as necessary to answer your inquiry and for internal record-keeping (up to 1 year).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Sharing Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. We may share aggregated, anonymized usage statistics (e.g., total downloads per file) with our hosting provider or analytics services. If required by law (e.g., court order), we may disclose your IP or technical data to law enforcement.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights (EEA Data Subjects)</h2>
    <p>If you reside in the EEA, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li><strong>Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> Request deletion of your personal data, unless we have a legal requirement to keep it.</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Ask us to restrict processing your data in certain circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Request to receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</li>
