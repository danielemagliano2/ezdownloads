    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>

    <p>
      This Cookie Policy explains how EZDownloads (“we”, “us”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on <a href="/">https://ezdownload.xyz</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files stored by your browser when you visit a website. They can be “session cookies” (deleted when you close your browser) or “persistent cookies” (remain on your device until they expire or are deleted).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      These cookies are essential for the Site to function properly. Without these, features such as file downloads or form submissions may not work. We set:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Session ID:</strong> A random session cookie to keep you logged in (if applicable).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Analytics & Performance Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      If you consent, we may use third-party analytics (e.g., Plausible or Cloudflare Analytics) to collect:
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited</li>
        <li>Referral source (e.g., search engine, social)</li>
        <li>Download button clicks</li>
        <li>Aggregate user behavior (no personally identifiable information)</li>
      </ul>
      You can choose to disable analytics cookies by adjusting your browser settings or by not consenting on our cookie banner (if shown).
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Fingerprinting & Bot Detection</h3>
    <p>
      We may run a minimal JavaScript-based fingerprinting script (e.g., BotD or FingerprintJS) to block bots and abuse. This script may read:
      <ul>
        <li>Browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system</li>
        <li>Screen resolution</li>
        <li>Installed fonts (limited set)</li>
      </ul>
      No persistent cookie is stored; data is used in memory only to determine if the visitor is a genuine user. You can opt-out by disabling JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How to Control Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      You can set or withdraw your consent for cookies at any time via your browser settings:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data</li>
        <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data</li>
        <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings → Site permissions → Cookies and site data</li>
        <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To completely block all cookies, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete existing cookies. Be aware that doing so may prevent certain features from working correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We do not embed any content that sets its own cookies (e.g., no YouTube embed cookies, no social widgets). If we add third-party services in the future, this section will be updated accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Cookie Policy occasionally. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when this version was published. Please review this page periodically.
